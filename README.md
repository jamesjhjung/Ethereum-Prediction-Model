# Project 1

### Goals
The goal of this project is to design a model that predicts the price of Ethereum cryptocurrency given its past prices. The model was built using a Keras Long Short-Term Memory neural network for time series forecasting.

### Process

#### EDA
Exploratory data analysis was performed to determine the most appropriate feature/variable to be used in the LSTM model.

#### Modeling
Initial run of modeling revealed that the predictions were not at all consistent with the actual values. Further testing and adjustments are required for the model to perform at its anticipated performance.
